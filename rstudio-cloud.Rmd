## What is RStudio Cloud?

<br>

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
.large[We created [**RStudio Cloud**](https://rstudio.cloud/) to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers, and students to do, share, teach, and learn data science using R.]
]

```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud.png")
```

---

## Why RStudio Cloud?

- Does not require IT support
- Git works out of the box
- Knit to PDF and Word works out of the box

--
- Features designed for instructors:
  - Classes can be organized in workspaces
  - Members can be assigned different roles: instructor, TA, student
  - Projects can be public or private
  - Projects can be made into assignments 
  - Students can make copies of projects created by instructor
  - Instructor can peek into student projects
  - A base project template can ensure same packages in each new project created in the workspace

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/get-started.png")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/login.png")
```

---


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-1.png")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/landing-2.png")
```

---

## Workspaces

- When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own

- You can add a new workspace and control its permissions

- Projects in either workspace can be public or private

---

## Projects

.pull-left[
A new project in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is a new project in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-local.png")
```
]

.alert[
**PSA:** If you use RStudio, use projects! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Find out more on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
]

---

## Projects from Git

.pull-left[
A new project from Git Repo in RStudio Cloud
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-cloud.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
is the same as a new project from Git in RStudio IDE
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-project-git-local.png")
```
]

Both options `clone` a Git repo

## Pros / cons: Sharing a single project

<br>

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- You can't keep track which students started their assignment
- Students control permissions (they can share it with each other without your permission)
]

---

## Remote teaching: Sharing a single project

<br>

`r emo::ji("-1")` You can't easily peek into student projects -- they would need to explicitly share the project with you

- They need to set access level to

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/workspace-access.png")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
- Make workspace shared for a short period of time, share link with students, enroll them as contributors.
- After initial round of enrolment (e.g. drop/add) switch over to this access level
- Use invitations for visitors added mid-semester

## Permission levels

| role        | permission                                       | course role |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| admin       | manage users, view, edit and manage all projects | instructor  |
| moderator   | view, edit and manage all projects               | TA          |
| contributor | create, edit and manage their own projects       | student     |
| viewer      | view projects shared with everyone               | auditor     |

## Base projects

One of the most attractive features of RStudio Cloud!

- Packages you want *installed* on all student projects

--
- Text documents you want to appear on **all** student projects (e.g. code of conduct, turn-in instructions, etc.)

--
- Applies to all projects created **after** base project has been specified, doesn't apply retroactively

--
- Can be updated as many times as you like throughout the course (without having to convince your IT!!!)

## Inviting a student to a workspace

.right[ .large[ `r emo::ji("woman_technologist")`  ]  ]

---

## Git integration

`r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Only relevant if teaching with Git & GitHub!

--

`r emo::ji("grin")` Base project template can be used, so new project from Git also has the right packages installed!

--

`r emo::ji("disappointed")` Need to introduce yourself to Git **once for each project**. Start each assignment with one of the following:
.small[
- In the *Terminal*:
```
git config user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config user.email "mona.lise@example.com"
```
- In the R *Console*:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Mona Lisa", user.email = "mona.lise@example.com")
```
]

---

## Pros / cons: Sharing a workspace

.pull-left[
### Good!

- Various permission levels
- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments, which remove the need to remind students to make a copy of the project before starting work
- Ability to peek into students’ projects
]
--
.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- Git config for each project can get tedious and doesn't reflect realistic practice
]

---

## Remote teaching: Sharing a workspace

`r emo::ji("+1")` You **can** easily peek into student projects

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/view-derived-projects.png")
```

---

## Common pitfalls

- Changes you make after student launches a project under either model (single project or workspace) won’t propagate to their project


--
- Packages in the base project will be **installed** in all projects in the workspace, but not **loaded**
  - If you need students to run code in the Console that requires a package, your instructions should remind them to load the package first
  - If using Rmd document, add a `load-package` chunk on top

## `r emo::ji("parcel")` rscloud

- A new package for managing RStudio Cloud spaces with R: [github.com/rstudio/rscloud](https://github.com/rstudio/rscloud)
- Requires an API key, which any instructor can request (via email for now, but soon in the UI as well)

# Parting remarks

## Tips

- Each project is allocated 1GB of RAM
  - Test things out before assignments involving large datasets 

- What your students see is not always what you see
  - Create a secondary account and add as a student

---

## More tips

- Remind students how to hide the sidebar!
